There are three cells in my code which are commented for varioius reasons.

First cell converts .nii into .dcm data. It is commented beacause it is meant to run only once or else it will create multiple .dcm files of same .nii folder.

Second cell transforms 3d array of .dcm data into form of .nii for ease of plotting.(Elaborated in readme.md). It is commented beacuse if run multiple times, it will constantly transform 3d array.

Third cell is code for sliders to plot scan. It was commented beacuse there was some trouble with github not able to display ipywidget.
